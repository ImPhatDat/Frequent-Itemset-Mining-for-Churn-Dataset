# Frequent-Itemset-Mining-for-Churn-Dataset

## Course: CSC14004 - DATA MINING AND APPLICATIONS

This is a course work from the Data Mining and Applications course, which experiments with a Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) algorithm: __Tree Projection__ (a variant of the Apriori algorithm). And using this to analyze and get useful insights and association rules from the __Churn Dataset__.
