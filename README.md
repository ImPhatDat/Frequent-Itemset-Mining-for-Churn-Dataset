# Frequent-Itemset-Mining-for-Churn-Dataset

## Course: CSC14004 - DATA MINING AND APPLICATIONS

This is a course work from the Data Mining and Applications course, in which I implement and experiment with a Frequent Itemset Mining (FIM) algorithm: __Tree Projection__ (a variant of the Apriori algorithm). Then, using this algorithm to help analyze and get useful insights or association rules from the __Churn Dataset__.
